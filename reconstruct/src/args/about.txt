This application decompresses IQZip/SparSDR compressed files. It can be used offline with regular files for input
and output, or in real-time using standard input/standard output or named pipes.

This version uses the compressed sample format that the Pluto FPGA image produces. It is not compatible with the USRP
N210 format.

By default, the application assumes that the compressed file was recorded with 61.44 Mhz of bandwidth. It decompresses
the full signal using an inverse FFT of size 1024.

There are two supported methods to decompress a smaller range of frequencies.

Method 1: Specify a non-zero center frequency and a number of bins less than 1024. The bins around the center frequency
will be decompressed.

Method 2: Specify one or more decompression bands. If method 2 is used, the center frequency, bins, and destination
arguments must not be provided.
